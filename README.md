# Portable SpaceCraft | Team Curious

Hello there. We're **Team Curious**. We are participating in *NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020*. The name of the project is **Portable SpaceCraft**.


### Short Description of our project

Nowadays lot's of spacecraft are launched for various purposes and they are damaged in many ways. And their replacement is very hard. We thought that, if we can arrange the spacecraft parts in the space, then it will decrease the potential damage rate and inactivity of a spacecraft.

So, our goal is to find a way, to simply launch bigger missions with less risk and increase the lifeline of spacecraft. And in our research we have found a way to assemble parts of the spacecraft in space.
